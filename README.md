# NN-from-Scratch-in-Raw-Python
Creating Artificial Neural Network in raw Python without using any ANN Libraries!
I am doing this project out of my interest in the inner workings of a Neural Network and to consolidate my understanding of Weights, Biases, Layers, Activation Function, Backpropogation and Epochs.
I will continue to update this Project if I find new ways to build a NN from scratch.
